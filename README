The WiFly BoosterPack equips your Launchpad with the ability to connect to 802.11b/g wireless networks.  The design uses the Launchpad's UART hardware to interface to Roving Network's RN171XV ultra-low power embedded TCP/IP module.  An external antenna can be attached via a standard RP-SMA connector. Due to its small form factor and extremely low power consumption, it is perfect for mobile wireless applications such as asset monitoring, sensors, and portable battery operated devices. The WiFly BoosterPack is compatible with the MSP430 LaunchPad and Tiva C LaunchPad (previously Stellaris). This board is designed by Sakoman Inc.
